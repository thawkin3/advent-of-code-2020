# Advent of Code 2020

The code here contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 challenge found here: https://adventofcode.com/2020.

I used JavaScript since that's the language I'm most familiar with. I solved these challenges using a test-driven development approach, so each solution has accompanying tests.

## Running the Code Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn test`
